FlameCut CNC Plasma Table

FlameCut CNC was designed to be a low-cost, easy to assemble, hackable but fully capable plasma table. Many of the material choices were made to satisfy that goal. I am sure many people will know of better materials, but usually at a higher cost. Feel free to substitute them. Almost everything that is not an off the shelf item can be made with a drill press, a miter saw or band saw.
